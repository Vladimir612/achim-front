In addition to scientific knowledge, it is about developing and disseminating concrete solutions that are appropriate to the nervous system for politics, business, health, education and social sectors. Some of these solutions already exist and some of the scientific findings still need to be translated into concrete options for action. In addition to specialists and managers, the forum addresses private individuals through brochures, social media, etc. and promotes options for actions appropriate to the nervous system for ”personal use” in relationships, upbringing or in dealing with oneself."

The second pillar is a – in the long term perspective – a global party that, on the one hand, advocates for a society that is more compatible with the nervous system, but on the other hand does not adapt to the existing political structures. More important than achieving concrete election results is establishing an alternative style of politics that aims at solidarity and ”well-being” instead of generating power."

To this end, political and civil society structures are specifically involved. Local groups work within their sphere of influence, use the citizens' consultation hours of their representatives and local networking structures to promote centrally controlled campaigns. Working groups and political alliances emerge. In the accompanying training sessions, in addition to the cognitive level, the heart level and the cellular level are also addressed."

Non-transparent shadow parts are dangerous for the forum because they prevent trauma integration. We will often not meet our demands because this does not allow our development as individuals and as energy bodies. We make the discrepancy between expectations and reality transparent. We will also receive financial support generated by exploitative capitalist means. We also make the shadows of the resources made available to us transparent."
