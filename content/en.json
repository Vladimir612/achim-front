      "fullText": "The Forum for Trauma and Nervous System is a feel, do and think tank, it is a transformation vision to join in. Our thesis is that the individual and collective state of our nervous system determines the state of our world. In order for a sustainable, positive change in the world, it makes sense to look at the causes of conflicts and crises in our nervous systems, instead of working just on the symptoms. Only if there are more safe spaces for all people and therefore more regulated nervous systems, we can find solutions to the challenges that our global society is facing. \n\nAll people have their own individual trauma structures, their own stories, survival mechanisms and life circumstances. But they all have a nervous system that functions according to exactly the same principles. And very few people are aware of these principles. Very few grow up knowing that stress and danger activate the amygdala and inhibit the cerebral cortex, which is responsible for cognitive abilities. How many students are labelled as unschoolable or not smart just because they lack safety and their amygdala is strongly activated? What a huge potential would arise if society offered these children safe spaces, e.g. at school, in which their amygdala could relax and the inhibition of the cerebral cortex could be lifted. \n\nLife courses that are characterised by addiction, poverty, crime, violence or mental illness are closely linked to traumatic experiences. What would happen if we as a society did not tackle the symptoms by bearing the costs of police operations, prisons, psychiatric drugs, psychiatrists, social workers etc.,but instead tackle the causes directly and invest in safe spaces. What would a society look like in which there were more safe spaces and thus more capable cerebral cortexes? How much potential would unfold? If people had safe spaces to develop, would there still be a shortage of skilled labour and would prisons, hospitals and psychiatric wards etc. still be as busy as they are today? How would the school system change? How would politics be organised? What impact would this have on the media and culture? \n\nTo find out, the Forum for Trauma and the Nervous System is embarking on a journey towards a trauma-informed and nervous system-friendly society. The Forum for Trauma and the Nervous System is a practical and holistic transformational movement that connects all relevant levels. We want that the knowledge about trauma and the nervous system to be part of the basic education, just like arithmetic, reading and writing. We strive for all social structures to be aligned with the principles of the human nervous system. \n\nFrom trauma-informed and nervous system-oriented puplic authorities, schools, universities, prisons and hospitals to a regenerative corporate world, trauma-sensitive media, pornography, sex work, non-governmental organisations and a nervous system-friendly language and culture. The need for change is as unlimited as the possibilities that arise from a nervous system-orientated approach. And we would be delighted if you join in, in a way that suits your nature, your nervous system and your life situation."

      "fullText": "In all its activities and manifestations, the Forum is guided by basic principles that give us orientation. The basic principles and the human image behind them are the compass that guides our actions and is the link and common foundation of an emerging global network with all its diversity. Basic principles: 1. the principle of the 2 pillars Like a pendulum, the forum swings back and forth between the pillar of 'going outwards' in the form of passing on knowledge to society and the pillar of 'going inwards' in the form of creating safe spaces in which we look within ourselves and perceive and integrate our shadows. 2. storytelling The forum brings the issue of trauma together with the issue of social justice and creates a powerful vision of a trauma-informed, more just and peaceful society with effective social systems. 3. shame avoidance and self-image retention ...are powerful driving forces within ourselves that cause us to block out those aspects of reality that draw our attention to our own inner pain and reflect our own incompleteness. In order to avoid shame and maintain our self-image, we create stories about ourselves and the world. In the forum, we discover and question these stories. We are honest with ourselves and others and treat each other lovingly from the outset as vulnerable and unfinished beings. We draw our strength from this honesty and transparency and meet the outside world at eye level. 4. multi-perspectivity The central starting point is to focus on the perspective of those 'affected' by the support systems and not to make the process of generating and passing on knowledge a 'white' bourgeois bubble. We are aware of the limitations of our own perspectives and try to integrate as many social perspectives as possible into the forum. 5 The scaling and effectiveness principle Everything that the Forum builds is geared towards the greatest possible scalability and effectiveness. Knowledge about trauma is to be fed into the systems at the nodes with the greatest reach. To this end, political and civil society structures are specifically integrated. Local groups work in their field of activity, use their representatives' office hours and local networking structures to promote centrally managed campaigns. Working groups and political alliances are formed. In addition to the cognitive level, the heart level and the cell level are also addressed in accompanying training sessions. 6 The principle of transparent shadows Our inner shadow parts are welcome. Instead of hiding them, we bring them to light and practice integrating them lovingly into our self-image. Non-transparent shadow parts are dangerous for the forum as they prevent trauma integration. We will often not meet our standards because this does not yet allow our development as individuals and as energy bodies. We make the discrepancy between aspiration and reality transparent. We will also receive financial support generated by exploitative capitalism. We also make the shadows of the resources made available to us transparent. 7 The principle of organic hierarchy The forum shows itself to us with varying degrees of clarity. The more clearly someone can see and feel the forum, the more decision-making authority the person has. The forum is flexible and clear in its work. It will grow quickly. The slowness of grassroots democratic decision-making is not suitable for the forum in the first few years. The 2-pillar principle provides safe spaces for slowness, pausing, feeling, and healing. 8 The principle of harmony Controversial discussions and the bursting force of intense feelings are welcome and are part of a healthy and vibrant energy body. Power struggles are not part of this healthy vitality. Striving for power may and should be reflected in a safe space and transformed into growth. However, it is not possible to change the foundations of the forum on its journey. Inner ruptures with the forum can and will lead to partings and re-encounters. Those who cannot support the forum can go their own way for a while until their soul can reconnect with the forum. 9 The principle of listening Every being can and should contribute to the forum according to their abilities and interests. Where does my soul and my body feel at the right place? We listen into ourselves, to the universe and to life to hear what we are being called to do. This can create new fields of action, inside and outside the forum. 10 Spirituality In the forum we practice connecting with our higher self. Free from religious dogma, we establish a spiritual practice that is completely voluntary and comfortable even for atheists. 11. regenerative working We try to adapt workplaces to the respective individual needs of the nervous system and to design working conditions, including the salary structure, in a joint process. 12. research space for social transformation We are guided by the desire to open a research space for sustainable social action and new social structures. We see a need to contribute to change, as we recognize that a nervous system-oriented and trauma-sensitive life and work is made more difficult by the current social and economic system.",

Our animal structures are geared towards competition, power, possession, and self-interest, whereas our real human parts want to serve, are able to share, are compassionate and prefer to give rather than take. We carry both within us and both are a natural part of us. Regardless of whether Martinus Thomsen is right in what he perceived and shared after opening his consciousness, it is a very nervous system-friendly world view that can be a great resource for us. If you want to know more about it, you can watch this video or browse Martinus.dk. Martinus himself writes in the preface to his main work that if something else resonates with you more than his cosmology, then something else is just right for you. And you should not follow him blindly but examine for yourself what suits your truth and what serves you. We use cosmology in the forum work as a supportive tool that is allowed to play a part where it is welcome."

      "fullText": "This is how Achim describes the moment of origin... Shortly before Christmas 2021, I watched the Netflix documentary 'Home', which is about homeless people. In minute 30, a social worker talks to a woman named Patty who has been affected by violence and is in shock and tells her she needs to make an effort for a better future. While the social worker's dog cuddles with the traumatized woman and helps her to regulate herself, the social worker apparently does not know that when the amygdala is activated by great danger, the cerebral cortex is only able to function to a limited extent and Patty cannot hear or understand him properly and in a state of shock has no resources to 'make an effort for a better life'. I was surprised and annoyed that the social worker, trained and paid by the system, did not respond effectively to Patty's nervous system condition while the dog instinctively did everything right and supported Patty effectively. Then I went on to think that not only do social workers have little knowledge about trauma and the nervous system, but this knowledge is lacking in all other systems, from kindergarten to school, hospitals, government agencies and businesses.That night I fell asleep with the concept of this huge collective knowledge gap on my mind. After two hours, I woke up with my heart pounding and my synapses running hot. I was tingling all over and a strong energy flowed through me. The basic outline of the forum emerged. The next day the first brief concept was ready and in the following months more and more details became visible. The forum vision is like a book that decides for itself which page to open and make visible. It feels as if the forum is an independent living being that has turned to me to accompany it into the material and into our lives. I have no copyright on it and the forum belongs to life itself, from which it also springs. It is finished and complete. In contrast to me, who is an unfinished being and only has the task of protecting the forum and accompanying it into life. In doing so, I also have to protect the forum from myself, my ego, and my wounded inner children. Perhaps the forum also protects itself, as the book closed again after a retraumatizing experience and I had to work on my own healing before the book opened again. The forum is so large and so infinitely loving that I can only guess at its outlines. At the same time, it is clear and structured and many possible processes are already visible in detail. As part of life, the forum unfolds independently and I am infinitely grateful that I can be so closely involved in this process, which is carried by a universal, all-pervading love."
